Hello!
Here's a Base64 password snippet!
I am also including the HEX and keys that I used. These will be towards the bottom in case you don't want to have it spoiled for you.
I'm including them because I literally just typed random stuff until it worked.

`2AImnUg2C0fGwUAxGrDelbKB+APksrgdO0QeRveGcg4D8HiM//PRJT51ngX3WDblmJ/K0iObOK4D6+yDwubXeg+GrrxvcUDr/KPYsPEpW39/7ZJgzeQ+qZr2/GbPi8bx0vx3Bs9DXDkcBcawXMbVpdyeJBNIRC2siIhTKrSrHEs=`


so, that's the code snippet
have fun practicing fellow white hats!!!!

this is my first time writing a decode-able snippet, so I'm sorry if it's bad. That's why I've added the keys I used


KEYS BE AHEAD

Here are the keys:

AES encrypt key:
`4e9906e8fcb66cc9faf49310620ffee8f496e806cc057990209b09a433b66c1b`

IV Hex:
`1928473927346273648329286734876`


SPOILER ON HOW TO SOLVE:

1. decode from b64
2. encode to hex (delimiter none)
3. AES decrypt (keys provided)
4. decode text via UTF-16LE (1200)
if done correctly, you should see some text!
