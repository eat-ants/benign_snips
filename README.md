Here is some **FAKE** malicious code snippets I have created! These can be decoded in remunex or CyberChef to recieve a message. 
I literally went into CyberChef, typed a message like "you found the password!" and am posting the output after multiple encryptions here for junior white hats to play around with.
There is ZERO risk of infection with these snippets.
