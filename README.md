Here is some **FAKE** malicious code snippets I have created! These can be decoded in remunex or CyberChef to recieve a message. 
I literally went into CyberChef, typed a message like "you found the password!" and am posting the output after multiple encryptions here for junior white hats to play around with.

There is ZERO risk of infection with these snippets.

However, just to be completely safe online as I am a total stranger, you should still play around with these snips in the browser and with .txt files just in case.
When messing around with stuff like this, you should also disable auto-run on your computer. And, please, do NOT open or download ANY files!


Goodbye and have fun, my little whites!

And remember:
**BE TWICE AS CAUTIOUS AS YOU THINK YOU NEED TO BE**
